    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a platform agnostic version of the classic game that can be used as backend. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Additionally, it needs to fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has to be designed for **2 or more players** who will roll **a single 6 sided die**\n",
    "* The outcome of the roll of the die will be **random**\n",
    "* Snakes will take players downwards, ladders upwards\n",
    "* The board will be a **10x10 grid** and players will **start at square 1**\n",
    "* The players wil move their token across the board using the roll of a single die\n",
    "* If the players land in square 97 they will need to roll a 3 in order to win. If they roll anything over 3 they will have to wait until they roll a 3 or lower.\n",
    "* The first player to land in the **final square (n¬∫ 100) wins the game** and the bragging rights"

    "3. Repeat the following until one of the players lands in square 94 to 99:\n",
    "    * Roll the die\n",
    "    * Move forward the number of squares indicated in the die\n",
    "    * If it lands on a ladder, you go up, if it's a snake down (as indicated in the dictionary). Else remain in the square.\n",
    "    * It's the turn of the other player\n",
    "4. From square 94 to 99:\n",
    "    * Players landing in square 94, 96, 97 or 98 can only move if they roll the exact squares until 100 or less. If they roll over, they loose their turn and have to wait.\n",
    "    * The player that lands in square 95 or 99 will get bitten by a snake and move back.\n",
    "    * The player that first lands in square 100 will win the game.\n",
